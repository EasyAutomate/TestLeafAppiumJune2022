1. Appium can automate only visible portion of screen
2. In most of the cases (Native app) we would be using XPATH as the locator since most of the app would be built earlier before we start the automation. So we need be careful in writing the XPATH. Note: Never use the index option as it changes based on the screen size. Try to use other option to write your XPATH eg. with text, preceding, following etc.
3. If you search an element in Appium Inspector and click, it might not hightlight in image (Known bug from 1.21.0. Use 1.20.X to overcome this issue)
4. To inspect or use Appium inspector for hybrid apps, click the web icon on top, choose the dropdown option for Webview and then start inspecting it. I recommend to use Chrome Inspector (chrome://inspect) rather using Appium inspector for Hybrid App (WebView) and Mobile web
5. Appium inspector cannot identify the overlapping elements. We need to manually identify the element in source code and identify the locators.
6. To locate Id and Name locators in Hybrid App (WebView) and Mobile web is not working in Appium. NoSuchElementException would be thrown. Known issue for more than a year. We need to convert Id and Name as Xpath and to inspect the element.
7. If the screenshot is disabled in App, Appium will not be able to identify the locators. We need to ask Dev team to provide a build to identify the locators.
8. If app is obfuscated then we might have challenges in identifying the locators. We might need to use XPATH for all the places eventhought id/name is provided by the dev team
9. In case if we have added only "app" as part of desired caps, while trying to launch the app we may end up with error stating "Not a launchable activity"/"app permission denied". In that case add appPackage and appActivty along with the existing desired capabilities.
10. During swipe, check if the starting co-ordinates are not overlapping with any other element
11. In case, if swipe is not working try to print the co-ordinates, validate the same in Appium inspector
12. If you work for a long time in web view and then switch to Native, there are chances of socket hangup. To overcome add newCommandTimeout with a greater time duration
13. autoGrantPermissions capability will click all elements with id as button1
14. In iOS, we need to manually identify the keyboard and then click on the keys
15. For  numeric keyboard, hidekeyboard() wont work. Identify the element and the click on it
16. In webViews, Keyboard has to be switched to Native then perform the action and then switch back to WebView 
17. Toast/Capacha cannot be automated
18. driver.executeScript will work only if relaxed security flag is enabled
19. In iOS, web view id is dynamic. So it is difficult to use exact web view in driver.context()
20. Check if any other web view/browser is opened if we automate hybrid/web app. So kill all the other running apps before the test starts.
